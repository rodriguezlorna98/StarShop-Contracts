/// Payment Escrow Contract
/// 
/// This is the main contract struct that implements a decentralized payment escrow system
/// with arbitrator dispute resolution. The contract provides secure peer-to-peer transactions
/// with automated fund management and dispute handling capabilities.
/// 
/// Key Features:
/// - Payment creation and management with expiry periods
/// - Two-phase delivery confirmation (seller → buyer)
/// - Dispute resolution system with authorized arbitrators
/// - Expired payment claim functionality
/// - Contract upgrade capability with state preservation
/// - Multiple arbitrator support with dynamic management

    /// can only be initialized once to prevent re-initialization attacks.

    /// * `env` - The Soroban environment
    /// * `arbitrator` - The address of the initial arbitrator
    ///

    /// current arbitrators to ensure security and prevent unauthorized upgrades.

    /// - Requires authorization from all arbitrators (consensus mechanism)
    /// - Preserves all existing contract state during upgrade
    /// - Prevents unauthorized upgrades that could compromise the system
    /// 
    /// # Upgrade Process
    /// 1. All arbitrators must authorize the upgrade
    /// 2. New WASM code is deployed to the contract
    /// 3. All existing state (payments, arbitrators, etc.) is preserved
    /// 4. Contract continues to function with new code
    /// 
    /// # Important Notes
    /// - The new WASM must be compatible with existing state structure
    /// - All arbitrators must be available to authorize the upgrade
    /// - Upgrade should be thoroughly tested before deployment
